Project #2: Parser.
CECS 444 Friday Section 1 PM

Team Name: Code Talkers
Members: 
Ruben Baerga ID#010366978
Eric Aguirre ID #010366978

For this project, we compiled and ran our code using NetBeans IDE Version 8.2.

Files: parseIt.java, grammar.txt, Deliverable1.pdf, parseTable.csv

Eric provided the First Sets, Follow Sets, and A6 Grammar with Left Recursion 
Elimination in the .pdf file.

Ruben wrote code logic to produce the parseTable.csv file.

Code: Mainly done by Ruben with conceptual help by Eric and some minor coding.
Features complete: Made a parse table and small working parse machine.
The program can take in a grammar and attempt to make a parse table out of it.
Currently, the code demonstrates the results of successfully parsing a small line
for a very tiny single - line grammar.


Bugs remaining: PST and AST construction not implemented.
